@W: MT529 :"c:\users\kt\my projects\dac_interface\lattice_project\dac\source\baud_gen.v":32:0:32:5|Found inferred clock top|clk which controls 252 sequential elements including uart_block.baud_gen_1.counter[15:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
